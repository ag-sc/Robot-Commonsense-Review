abstract={Autonomous robots often require domain knowledge to act intelligently in their environment. This is particularly true for robots that use automated planning techniques, which require symbolic representations of the operating environment and the robot's capabilities. However, the task of specifying domain knowledge by hand is tedious and prone to error. As a result, we aim to automate the process of acquiring general common sense knowledge of objects, relations, and actions, by extracting such information from large amounts of natural language text, written by humans for human readers. We present two methods for knowledge acquisition, requiring only limited human input, which focus on the inference of spatial relations from text. Although our approach is applicable to a range of domains and information, we only consider one type of knowledge here, namely object locations in a kitchen environment. As a proof of concept, we test our approach using an automated planner and show how the addition of common sense knowledge can improve the quality of the generated plans.},

abstract={In this paper we present the concept and realization of a semantic mapping system for a mobile outdoor robot. Semantic maps aim to give robots the ability to gather semantic information about their environment, to store it, represent it for the user, and to perform high-level tasks based on the semantic information. The map is build by a system integrating the combination of object classification and common-sense knowledge. We validate the proposed semantic map representation on a real-world 3D point cloud dataset. The presented classification approach achieves an overall precision about 96 %. The semantic maps result into a data structure which offers the opportunity to solve complex task settings and can be integrated onto real robotic systems.},

title={Efficient Dynamic Object Search in Home Environment by Mobile Robot: A Priori Knowledge-Based Approach},
year={2019},
volume={68},
number={10},
pages={9466-9477},
abstract={The capability of object search is a prerequisite for mobile robot to perform everyday tasks in the home environment. Due to the dynamic nature of object and the particularity of home environment, it still remains a challenging problem for mobile robot to find the dynamic target object with the low total cost. To address this problem, a priori knowledge-based approach for dynamic object search is presented in this paper. Inspired by human search process, the common sense knowledge about typical spatial location and the relationship between objects is modeled as a priori knowledge. On this basis, we propose a novel search strategy to improve the search efficiency of mobile robot at the scale of the entire home environment. Unlike the existing methods, a trade-off between the inferred spatial location knowledge and the distance of robot position and candidate room is considered, which permits robot to prioritize the search effort for the candidate room in which the target object is most likely to be found. Also, the search space inside the room is further reduced by using a priori knowledge-guided search heuristics. Meanwhile, the update of knowledge is also investigated to maintain its reliability. The proposed approach is implemented in both simulation and real environments, and evaluated through extensive experiments. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal.},

title={Recommending Fine-grained Tool Consistent with Common Sense Knowledge for Robot},
year={2022},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8},
abstract={When robots carry out task, selecting an appropriate tool is necessary. The current research ignores the fine-grained characteristic of tasks, and mainly focuses on whether the task can be completed. Little consideration is paid for the object being manipulated, which affects the task completion quality. In order to support task oriented fine-grained tool recommendation, based on common sense knowledge, this paper proposes Fine-grained Tool-Task Graph (FTTG) to describe multi-granularity semantics of tasks, tools, objects being manipulated and relationships among them. According to FTTG, a Fine-grained Tool-Task (FTT) dataset is constructed by labeling images of tools and objects being manipulated with the defined semantics. A baseline method named Fine-grained Tool Recommendation Network (FTR-Net) is also proposed in this paper. FTR-Net gives coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic predictions by simultaneously learning the common and special features of the tools and objects being manipulated. At the same time, FTR-Net constrains the distance between features of the well matched tool and object more smaller than that of those unmatched. The constraint and the special feature ensure FTR-Net provide fine-grained tool recommendation. The constraint and the common feature ensure FTR-Net provide coarse-grained tool recommendation when the fine-grained tools are not available. Experiments show that FTR-Net can recommend tools consistent with common sense whether on test data sets or in real situations.},

abstract={As an important information resource, visual perception has been widely employed for various indoor mobile robots. The common-sense knowledge about object locality (CSOL), e.g. a cup is usually located on the table top rather than on the floor and vice versa for a trash bin, is a very helpful context information for a robotic visual search task. In this paper, we propose an online knowledge acquisition mechanism for discovering CSOL, thereby facilitating a more efficient and robust robotic visual search. The proposed mechanism is able to create conceptual knowledge with the information acquired from the largest and the most diverse medium - the Internet. Experiments using an indoor mobile robot demonstrate the efficiency of our approach as well as reliability of goal-directed robot behaviour.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={136-140},
abstract={The necessary amount of commonsense knowledge for autonomous domestic service robots is enormous and avoiding inconsistencies is consequently almost impossible. This is especially true for inconsistencies on a semantic level, that is, inconsistencies as interpreted by human beings where the properties of a concept may contradict each other. In contrast to Boolean algebra (¬A and A), these inconsistencies will not lead to a trivial solution like false, since they are not captured in a logic formalism. Instead, they will result in semantic contradictions when interpreting the solution. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a way to handle semantic inconsistencies, by utilising a commonsense knowledge database and implementing a dynamic knowledge base that is capable of resolving contradicting parts of knowledge. The applied non-monotonic reasoning mechanism is Answer Set Programming, and ConceptNet5 is the commonsense knowledge database. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach and show its advantages in a complete household scenario.},

abstract={Providing autonomous humanoid robots with the abilities to react in an adaptive and intelligent manner involves low level control and sensing as well as high level reasoning. However, the integration of both levels still remains challenging due to the representational gap between the continuous state space on the sensorimotor level and the discrete symbolic entities used in high level reasoning. In this work, we approach the problem of learning a representation of the space which is applicable on both levels. This representation is grounded on the sensorimotor level by means of exploration and on the language level by making use of common sense knowledge. We demonstrate how spatial knowledge can be extracted from these two sources of experience. Combining the resulting knowledge in a systematic way yields a solution to the grounding problem which has the potential to substantially decrease the learning effort.},

abstract={Reminiscence is a lifelong activity that happens throughout our lifespan. While memories can serve as topics in people's everyday conversations, recalling the past can also help us build self-esteem and increase our level of happiness. In this paper, we aim to develop a robot companion that helps people to recollect their memories from personal photographs. We focus on how a robot can associate concepts relevant to the content in the photographs and evoke people's memories by asking questions that are both relatable and engaging. To understand the content of a picture, we applied deep learning techniques in order to recognize events, objects, and scenes in it. Then, these observations and any user utterances are considered in a Markov random field (MRF)-based algorithm that contains common sense knowledge of a number of events, with loopy belief propagation being used to infer possible associated concepts and topics. Afterward, the robot poses appropriate questions about the selected topics, guiding the user to reminisce through conversation. Our results show that the proposed system can pose related and appropriate questions to interact with the user, and has the potential guide the user to recall the past in an organized way.},

abstract={Data-driven sensor interpretation in autonomous driving can lead to highly implausible predictions as can most of the time be verified with common-sense knowledge. However, learning common knowledge only from data is hard and approaches for knowledge integration are an active research area. We propose to use a partly human-designed, partly learned set of rules to describe relations between objects of a traffic scene on a high level of abstraction. In doing so, we improve and robustify existing deep neural networks consuming low-level sensor information. We present an initial study adapting the well-established Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) framework to validate and improve on the problem of semantic segmentation. We describe in detail how we integrate common knowledge into the segmentation pipeline using PSL and verify our approach in a set of experiments demonstrating the increase in robustness against several severe image distortions applied to the A2D21 autonomous driving data set.},
